## Building ts2js

ts2js depends on [NPM](https://docs.npmjs.com/) as a package manager and 
[Gulp](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp/blob/master/docs/getting-started.md) as a build tool. 
If you haven't already, you'll need to install both these tools in order to 
build ts2js.

Once Gulp is installed, you can build it with the following commands:

```
npm install
gulp build
```
